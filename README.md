# 🚀 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my DSA repository! This repository is a reflection of my ongoing journey into mastering data structures and algorithms, with a focus on solving problems from platforms like LeetCode. 

## 🏗️ My Journey So Far

I embarked on this journey to sharpen my problem-solving skills and develop a deep understanding of how data structures and algorithms are applied in real-world scenarios. My aim is to become proficient in these concepts and be ready for coding interviews 💻.

### ✅ Topics Covered:

- **🔢 Arrays**: Learned various operations like traversal, insertion, deletion, and optimization techniques for arrays.
- **📚 Dictionaries**: Explored the use of dictionaries for fast lookups, and tackled problems that require efficient data organization.
- **🔗 Linked Lists**: Currently working on Linked Lists, where I’ve learned about appending, prepending, insertion, deletion, and reversing linked lists. I'm also solving relevant LeetCode problems to build strong intuition.
- **📃 Lists**: Mastered list manipulations including sorting, searching, and efficient use of list methods.
- **🔧 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Applied OOP principles to model and solve complex problems with a structured approach.
- **📦 Stacks**: Delved into stack operations (push, pop, peek) and how they apply to real-world problems like balanced parentheses, evaluating postfix expressions, and more.
- **🗂️ Tuples**: Understood the importance of immutable data structures and their specific use cases in algorithmic problems.

### 🔥 What I'm Working On Now:

- **🔗 Linked Lists and Stacks**: I’m currently honing my skills by solving Linked List and Stack exercises on LeetCode. Some challenges I’m focusing on include:
  - Implementing stacks using linked lists 🧑‍💻
  - Solving problems like detecting cycles, reversing linked lists, and evaluating stack-based algorithms.

### 🛠️ Next Step:

- **Queues**: After mastering Linked Lists and Stacks, my next area of focus will be learning about Queues. I'll explore different types such as circular queues and priority queues, and dive into problems like queue operations, sliding window problems, and more 📊.

## 🎯 Future Goals

I am excited to continue this journey by exploring more advanced data structures such as trees, graphs, and heaps. My focus is on continuous improvement and applying these concepts to solve increasingly complex problems.
